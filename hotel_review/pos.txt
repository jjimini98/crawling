 Only the park outside of the hotel was beautiful 
 No real complaints the hotel was great great location surroundings rooms amenities and service Two recommendations however firstly the staff upon check in are very confusing regarding deposit payments and the staff offer you upon checkout to refund your original payment and you can make a new one Bit confusing Secondly the on site restaurant is a bit lacking very well thought out and excellent quality food for anyone of a vegetarian or vegan background but even a wrap or toasted sandwich option would be great Aside from those minor minor things fantastic spot and will be back when i return to Amsterdam 
 Location was good and staff were ok It is cute hotel the breakfast range is nice Will go back 
 Great location in nice surroundings the bar and restaurant are nice and have a lovely outdoor area The building also has quite some character 
 Amazing location and building Romantic setting

No Positive
 The room was big enough and the bed is good The breakfast food and service on the hotel is good outside the hotel there is a big park which is very good for walk in the morning and evening Many people are having picnics and do some bicycling
